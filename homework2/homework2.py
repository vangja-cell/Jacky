# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
#    Git is a control system that tracks the changes you make to files.
#    GitHub is a web-based platform that host Git repositories, like a cloud storage that is designed for Git projects.
#    GitBash is a command-ine interface that allows you to interact with Git, like a terminal for Git.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
#    The terminal is the software that provides a text-based interface to interact with the device.
#    The command line is the specific line within the terminal where you can type out commands for the operating system to follow.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
#    PowerShell is native to the Windows environment while Git Bash operates like a Unix system. Data handling wise, Bash treats inputs and outputs as plain text while PowerShell operates with objects.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
#    Anaconda is a comprehensive distribution of Python and R that is tailored for scientific computing. 
#    Conda is a package and environment management system. 
#    Python is the core, that is the programming language itself.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
#    VS Code is a cross-platform code editor that was developed to write and edit code relating to softwares and operating systems.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
#    Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows for creating and sharing documents that contains codes, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Lab extends on this functionality by allowing users to work with a higher variety of file types, terminals, extensions, and tools.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
#    ~ is the home directory and the added / indicates that you are referring to a directory within the home directory.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#    An absolute path is the complete location of a directory that states the entire hierarchical structure from the root to the target file. A relative path states the location of a directory relative to the current working directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#    Absolute path: cd ~/OneDrive/python_decal_fa25/Jacky/course_assignments/homework2
#    Relative path: cd course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#     cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#     rm ./ will delete the current directory and all of its content

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add - add changes from the working directory to the staging area/index
# git commit - saves changes that have been staged in the local repository
# git push - uploads local changes/commits from local repository to a remote repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#     "git add ." will add all changes in the current directory and subdirectories to the staging area.
#     "git add <file>" adds a specific file to the staging area.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
#     git status tells you the status of your repository.
#     git log -1 displays the commit history of the repository.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#     Cloning creates a new, local copy of an existing remote repository that includes all files, branches, commit history, and data.
#     Pulling from a repository is to update its content with the latest changes from a remote repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#     This is not really a bug, but the most frustrating thing to deal with so far was finding the location of the python_decal_fa25 folder initially because it was hidden in my OneDrive. I asked a friend for help and we searched through all my directories for it.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#     I think so far the coding and materials have been explained very well, but I know that being put into a solo/individual work will be challenging since all terms are new to me. But revisiting the materials and definition will definitely help when I am working through problems.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#     I am currently coaching for a volleyball club here in the Berkeley city.

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(94 // 26)
# The // is a division operator, but the solution gets round down to the nearest whole number/integer.
