Brainstorm for the Final Project

1. 
 - Gravitational effects of black holes
 - Time dilation
 - Celestial objects collisions/interactions
 - Formation of massive stellar objects
 - Spatial curve of the universe

2. 
 - https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/exoplanet-catalog/
	- A catalog of discovered and recorded exoplanets. Planetary information will be useful for determining potential collision and interaction.
 - https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/07/65014/how-does-time-dilation-affect-aging-during-high-speed-space-travel/
	- An article about time dilation and how time is affected by stellar objects and events.
 - https://physics.weber.edu/palen/phsx1040/Lectures/Lcurvature.html
	- An article that describes how the universe is potentially curved using stellar objects to determine space density.

3. Chosen topic: Celestial objects collisions and interactions
 - I will use functions, conditionals, and the Python package SPOCK on GitHub to help me analyze potential collisions and the stability of planetary systems. 

4. 
Dream project: I want to create an interactive game-like simulation where users can generate a visual solar system and see how their planets are interacting or colliding. Mathemtical and physical calculations will be provided to create a better understanding of why events take place.
Realistic project: I want to create a simple RNG system where users will generate their own solar system and then will be given a simple analysis of their solar system's stability. No advanced visuals or interactive system.
